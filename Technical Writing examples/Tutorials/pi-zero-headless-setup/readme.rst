Pi Zero W Headless Setup
=========================

A `Pi Zero W`<https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-zero-2-w/> is your pocket sized little brother of the `Raspberry Pi`<https://www.raspberrypi.com/>.

An even smaller Single board computer, it can be used for a lot a fun little projects such as:

* A  small form factor `WiFi extender`<https://hackaday.io/project/171296-truly-wifi-extender>_. 
* A mini `ad-blocker using Pi-hole`<https://pi-hole.net/>_.
* A fun `video looper`<https://alexasteinbruck.medium.com/how-to-configure-your-raspberry-pi-zero-to-play-videos-in-a-loop-cheap-and-flexible-solution-for-42f7744ed5c5>_.
* `Many many others`<https://hackaday.io/projects?page=1&tag=raspberry%20pi%20zero>_.

Due to its small form factor, and comparatively weak HDMI signal, it's practical, even desirable, to set up a pi zero without a monitor using its headless features. 
This document serves as a guide to precisely that process.

Generally, Raspberry Pi products run their OS from the micro SD card kept in the slot. 
So, before starting your Pi Zero up, you need to flash the OS to an SD card.

The process is as follows:

1.  Go to the `Pi software page`<https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/>_ and download and install the Raspberry Pi imager/
