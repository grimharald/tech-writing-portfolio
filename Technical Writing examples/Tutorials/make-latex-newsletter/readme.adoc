= Make a Newspaper in LaTeX


https://www.latex-project.org/[LaTex] is a free to use text and typesetting software and language used to make adaptable documentation, first created in 1984. It is a distribution of https://tug.org/[TeX], and can be used to create an accurate pdf output. 

LaTeX has been built upon by users, resulting in a lot of packages, most of which are pre made to fit certain specific document types, ranging from academic papers (its most common use) to newspapers, as this guide will cover. 

This guide will cover: 

* Setting up an Overleaf account. 
* The code structure for creating a document.
* Using the necessary packages to format your pdf as a newspaper. 

== Creating an Overleaf Account

This guide uses https://www.overleaf.com[Overleaf] for document generation, as it is the most accessible way to use LaTeX. You can also https://www.latex-project.org/get/[Install LaTeX locally], if you wish, but this guide does not cover that process. 

To make an Overleaf account:

* Go to the https://www.overleaf.com/[website] and click `Register`. 
* You will be presented with this page, offering the registration options.

* Here you have four options:
** Input an email and password, and click `Register with your email`.
*** In this case, you will then need to confirm your email in your inbox.
** Register with Google. 
*** Select this, then connect the relevant Google Account. 
** Register with ORCID
*** This will open an ORCID sign-in/confirmation window, confirm to connect this account to Overleaf. 

After this, you will be redirected to the projects page.

== Making Your Document

This section will cover:

* Physically creating your document. 
* Adding the newspaper package for creation.
* Customising your paper's name, motto, and other details.

Create your first document by simply clicking the `New Project` button in the top left. Select `Blank Project` and name the document whatever you please.

You will be presented with an empty document in article format, with the package `graphicx` enabled.

Before writing anything, we need to set up the document to include the `newspaper` CTAN package (https://ftp.gwdg.de/pub/ctan/macros/latex/contrib/newspaper/newspaper.pdf[documented here]), and supporting packages to use it smoothly.

Begin by navigating to the preamble (everything before `\begin{document}`) and add `\usepackage{newspaper}` as the third line of the code. Recompile the document, and you will see the pdf generates a newspaper header. 

image::overleaf-newspaper-header.png[width=600]

As we haven't changed the paper's name, motto, volume, issue, or location, it currently uses the standard presets. Therefore, the example paper is named the _Committee Times_ and costs _ZERO DOLLARS_, etc.

To customise these, we will use the following macros in the preamble;

[source, Tex]
----
\SetPaperName{}
\SetHeaderName{}
\SetPaperLocation{}
\SetPaperSlogan{}
\SetPaperPrice{}
\currentvolume{}
\currentissue{}
----

Copy and paste this into your preamble, and input your chosen values.

My newspaper is going to be called, Grand Gazette, cost nothing, be based in Reykjavik (RVK),  use the slogan "It's educational. Sort of." as its motto. Each page will begin with a helpful reminder of the paper name and date of the issue. Therefore, my preamble will include these:

[source, Tex]
----
\SetPaperName{Grand Gazette}
\SetHeaderName{Grand Gazette}
\SetPaperLocation{RVK, Iceland}
\SetPaperSlogan{"It's educational. Sort of."}
\SetPaperPrice{Free}
\currentvolume{01}
\currentissue{01}
----

This will produce the following header on the main page:

image::overleaf-main-header.png[width=600]

Then this one on the following pages:

image::overleaf-next-header.png[width=600]

Now, we can move onto populating the document itself. However before I do that, I am going to add the following package lines into my newspapers preamble:

* `\usepackage{amsfonts}` - Sets up the following package, `times` for use in the document.
* `\usepackage{times}` - Changes the documents default document fonts to Helvetica, Times-Roman, and Courier. These are more "newspapery", at least in that they look more old fashioned 
* `\usepackage{multicol}` - Enables multi-column document set up.
* `\usepackage{enumitem}` - Basic package for using bulleted and numbered lists in documents. 

Apart from `multicols`, I'd say all of these are optional, when creating the paper, and come down to personal taste. I'll cover their use in the next section. 

Before moving onto the articles, themselves, I'll confirm my current preamble:

[source, Tex]
----
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{graphicx} % Required for inserting images
\usepackage{newspaper}
\usepackage{blindtext}

\title{Test}
\author{Huw Coverdale Jones}
\date{\today}

\SetPaperName{Grand Gazette}
\SetHeaderName{Grand Gazette}
\SetPaperLocation{RVK, Iceland}
\SetPaperSlogan{"It's educational. Sort of."}
\SetPaperPrice{Free}
\currentvolume{01}
\currentissue{01}
----

Yours needn't be exactly like this, but use it as a guide. Note that `blindtext` is only here for demonstration purposes later.

== Adding Articles

This section will cover:

* How to add articles. 
* How to customise article headlines.
* Adding pictures to your articles.

The first thing note is that, when using the `newspaper` package, introduce an article using `\headline{}`, while most LaTeX document types use `\section{}`. This will still work in a newspaper document, but won't look quite right. 

For example, using my preamble, the following code: 

[source, Tex]
----
\begin{document}

\maketitle

\section{Introduction}


\end{document}
----

Will produce this when you click `Compile` or `Recompile`:

image::overleaf-using-section.png[width=600]

Naturally, this looks more like an academic article (LaTeX's most popular usage).

However this code:

[source, Tex]
----
\begin{document}

\maketitle

\headline{Introduction}


\end{document}

----

Will produce this:

image::overleaf-using-headline.png[width=600]

This automatically centres and underlines the title.

However, you may notice that the Title loses a lot of its impact by not being emboldened, and having a small font size. https://ftp.gwdg.de/pub/ctan/macros/latex/contrib/newspaper/newspaper.pdf[The newspaper package documentation] actually encourages you to combine the `headline` macro with existing LaTeX format changes such as:

* `\bf` - Makes the text wrapped by `{}` bold. 
* `\large` - Makes the text wrapped by `{}` 11-12 point size. This is slightly larger than the default size in LaTeX, 10 point.
* `\Large` - Makes the text wrapped by `{}` 12-14 point size.
* `\LARGE` - Makes the text wrapped by `{}` 14-16 point size.
* If you wish it to be larger, there are two higher steps; `\huge` and `\Huge`.

Personally, I default to `\LARGE`, combined with `\bf`, but this is still up to personal preference. See https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Font_sizes%2C_families%2C_and_styles#Reference_guide[this overleaf guide] for more information on font sizes.

So, with this in mind, try the following code:

[source, Tex]
----
\begin{document}

\maketitle

\headline{\bf \LARGE Introduction}


\end{document}
----

And you'll see a marked improvement in the headline:

image::overleaf-improved-headline.png[width=600]

By all means, play around with different styles and emphasis to find your preferred combination.

Now, we can look at why I choose to use `muticols` package when writing my newspaper articles. Here I have generated two articles using `blindtext`. Pay special attention to the fact that I separate articles with `\closearticle`, as this is how you'll do the same: 

[source, Tex]
----
\begin{document}

\maketitle

\headline{\bf \LARGE Introduction}
\Blindtext[2]
\closearticle

\headline{\bf \LARGE Next}
\Blindtext[2]
\closearticle

\end{document}
----

Producing the following result:

image::overleaf-blindtext-paper.png[width=700]

Two articles piled on top of each other, which frankly looks wrong. So now I'll make the whole document default to a 2 column format:

[source, Tex]
----
\begin{document}
\maketitle
\begin{multicols}{2}

\headline{\bf \LARGE Introduction}
\Blindtext[2]
\closearticle

\headline{\bf \LARGE Next}
\Blindtext[2]
\closearticle

\end{multicols}
\end{document}
----

And I get something far more presentable: 

image::overleaf-multicols.png[width=700]

Now I'll change `\begin{multicols}{2}` to `\begin{multicols}{3}` and add another article:

[source, Tex]
----
\begin{document}
\maketitle
\begin{multicols}{3}

\headline{\bf \LARGE Introduction}
\Blindtext[2]
\closearticle

\headline{\bf \LARGE Next}
\Blindtext[2]
\closearticle

\headline{\bf \LARGE And Another}
\Blindtext[2]
\closearticle

\end{multicols}
\end{document}
----

And it looks a bit like this:

image::overleaf-3-cols.png[width=600]

Which you may prefer, though I tend to stick to 2. 

NOTE: It is *very important* to put `begin{multicols}{}` *AFTER* `\maketitle`

So, now you're almost ready to make your own articles, with the following steps:

* Begin by setting up a preamble using my guide above, setting your paper name, motto, issue, location etc.
* Begin a new article with `headline`, adding your chosen combination of `\bf`, `\LARGE` etc.
* End each article with `\closearticle`
* Click `Recompile` when you think it's ready. 

== Adding Images

Finally, I'll show you how to add pictures using the `graphicx` package which Overleaf includes in new documents as standard. 

Including images in LaTeX is a notoriously unpredictable process. Nonetheless, the image sizes and positions can all be customised, so this process is very much worth learning.

To demonstrate this process, I've created a test case guide to some churches in Iceland. It describes 3 churches, and naturally needs to use images.

To include the images I used the `\includegraphics[]{}` macro, but had to make some adjustments. I have three images uploaded into the overleaf editor. I use the `upload` icon in Overleaf to add these:

image::overleaf-upload-image.png[]

For example simply using `\includegraphics[]{church-1.jpg}` for the first image created an issue, due to the size of the image:

image::overleaf-bad-size.png[width=700]

Fortunately, the `[]` in `\includegraphics[]{}` enables you to change the size of the included image. So I adjusted the command to `\includegraphics[0.18]{church-1.jpg}`, which produced this:

image::overleaf-off-centre.png[width=700]

However, as you see, it offsets the image, cutting into the next column.
To fix this, I used the in-built LaTeX `centre` command, nesting the `\includegraphics` command like so:

[source, Tex]
----
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.18]{church-1.jpg}    
\end{center}
----

And was able to create the test case:

image::overleaf-church-guide.png[width=700]

When adding images, be sure to take this into account, though the only real fail safe method is to change the settings (`scale`, `center` etc.) and `Recompile` to see how it appears. 

== Summary

So what next? Well, now is the hard part, where you have to decide what your paper is about, and write the articles yourself. 

To restate the process once more:

* <<_creating_an_overleaf_account, Make your own Overleaf account>>.
* Create your document, ste it up with the right packages, and change your paper name etc. Use <<_making_your_document>> as a guide to this process.
* Set up your article titles, using the `\headline` command, including your own changes to the formatting. USe <<_adding_articles>> as a guide to doing this.
* If desired, <<_adding_images,add and edit your images>>.
* Write your newspaper.
